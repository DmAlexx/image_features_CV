Questions:
1. Does it matter whether the picture has been taken by a 1Mpx camera or a 12Mpx camera? How?
   - However, at different resolutions of the image, the scale of objects in the image changes.
   - For example, at higher resolutions, the image contains more details, and objects may be shown with a higher level of detail.
   - So 
3. If we increased the resolution of the camera, what would you change in the current algorithm?
